Testing CellOracle using a Pancreas dataset

With CellOracle, we propagate the displacements of the Transcription Factors through the GRN to infer the displacements of their target genes.

To build the network, we used the list of Transcription factors and its putative target genes from SCENIC (included in inputs) and the preprocessed pancreas dataset from scvelo.
